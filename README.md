# AUTOMATIC DYSTOPIA IDENTIFICATION ON A SCI-FI CORPUS

Welcome to the **Automatic Dystopia Identification** repository. This project aims to identify dystopian themes within a specialized corpus of science fiction, applying machine learning techniques to distinguish between dystopian and non-dystopian works.

## About This Repository ðŸ‘‹

In this repository, you can find the procedure of our experiments that helped us develop our research. Here is an overview of the contents:

- **Python Notebook**: A Jupyter notebook that trains and evaluates four different machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees) on the task of dystopian identification.
- **Data Analysis and Reporting Scripts**: Scripts to generate data reports, visualize performance metrics, and analyze feature importance.
- **DysCorpus Dataset**: The dataset used in this study, containing science fiction texts with labels indicating dystopian or non-dystopian themes.
