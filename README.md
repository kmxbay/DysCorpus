# AUTOMATIC DYSTOPIA IDENTIFICATION ON A SCI-FI CORPUS

Welcome to the **Automatic Dystopia Identification** repository. This project aims to identify dystopian themes within a specialized corpus of science fiction, applying machine learning techniques to distinguish between dystopian and non-dystopian works.

## About This Repository üëã

In this repository, you can find the procedure of our experiments that helped us develop our research. Here is an overview of the contents:

- **Python Notebook**: A Jupyter notebook that trains and evaluates four different machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees) on the task of dystopian identification.
- **Data Analysis and Reporting Scripts**: Scripts to generate data reports, visualize performance metrics, and analyze feature importance.
- **DysCorpus Dataset**: The dataset used in this study, containing science fiction texts with labels indicating dystopian or non-dystopian themes.

## Dataset üìö

The **DysCorpus dataset** includes science fiction titles along with metadata such as summaries, ideological themes, character development, and narrative style. This diverse set of features allows models to capture nuanced patterns in dystopian literature.

## Machine Learning Models üß† 
This study evaluates the performance of four different machine learning models for the task of dystopia identification:
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Decision Trees**
Each model was trained and validated on DysCorpus, with metrics recorded to compare performance across various feature configurations and text representations.
